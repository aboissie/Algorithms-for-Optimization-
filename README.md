## Table of Contents

- ``Existence, Uniqueness, Convexity``: Exploring the foundational concepts in optimization, including conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions and the role of convexity.
- ``Gradient Descent with Optimal Step``: Detailed analysis and implementation of the gradient descent algorithm, including adaptations for optimal step selection.
- ``Preconditioned Gradient Descent with Backtracking``: Advanced techniques for enhancing the convergence of gradient descent, including preconditioning and backtracking methods.
- ``Newton's Method``: Examination of Newton's method for optimization, covering both the pure and damped versions.
- ``Projected Gradient and Projection Method``: Techniques for dealing with constrained optimization problems, including the use of projections to enforce constraints.
- ``Optimization with Inequality Constraints``: Discussion of methods for handling optimization problems with inequality constraints, including penalty methods and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions.
- ``Lagrangian Duality``: In-depth exploration of duality in optimization, including weak and strong duality and the Uzawa algorithm.
